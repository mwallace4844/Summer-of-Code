# Summer-of-Code
2020 summer coding group using Python.
In this game you are Alexander Hamilton! Use the arrow keys to move around. When touching an ice cream, you can press "E" to eat it. You can press "P" to pick up a plate. You can press "D" to drop a plate. The goal of the game is to eat all the ice cream and to place all the plates on the conveyor belt in the least amount of time.
